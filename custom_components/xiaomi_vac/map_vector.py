    `md` is the parsed vacuum_map_parser_base.MapData. All overlay coords are
    expected in METRES by the card's SVG (font sizes, icon radii, padding are
    all metre-scale constants). `ijai_grid` is True only when `unpacked` is an
    ijai `RobotMap` protobuf (the sole source of the crisp labelled grid);
    other brands pass False and get the overlays-only contract.

    `scale` converts `md`'s NATIVE coordinate unit to metres — 1.0 for
    brands whose MapData is already metre-scale (ijai; presumably
    dreame/viomi too). The xiaomi-JSON brand's raw MIoT position unit is
    millimetres, not metres (confirmed 2026-08-01: room bbox extents came out
    ~10700x5900 unscaled — a 10km-wide "room" — which silently made every
    text label and the vacuum-position dot microscopic relative to the SVG
    viewBox, not actually missing). Callers pass `scale=0.001` for that case.

    `carpets` (optional): raw detected-carpet rectangles as 8-number flat
    lists `[x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4]`, same native unit as everything else
    in `md` — the xiaomi-JSON blob's own "carpets" field, which neither
    `vacuum_map_parser_xiaomi` nor this module's MapData source parses on
    its own (see the 2026-08-01 map.py `_draw_carpets` note). Caller is
    responsible for extracting them from the raw payload; this just scales
    and passes them through.

    `xiaomi_grid` (optional): the pre-built {size, bounds, resolution,
    grid_rle, legend} contract from `map.py`'s `MapFetcher._parse_xiaomi_grid`
    — already-decoded raw occupancy grid for xiaomi-JSON devices (already in
    METRES, no further `scale` multiplication needed here since that
    conversion happened at extraction time). Ignored when `ijai_grid` is
    True (ijai's own `extract_grid` is authoritative there).

    `path` (optional): the xiaomi-JSON blob's own "paths" trajectory, as a
    list of independent segments (each a list of `(x, y)` mm tuples),
    already filtered down to the real contiguous run AND split on the
    "new leg" `type` marker by `map.py`'s `MapFetcher._parse_path` (that
    field's array is a fixed-size buffer with unwritten `{0,0}` sentinel
    slots, and drawing every real point as ONE continuous line produces
    physically-impossible straight cuts through walls between legs —
    confirmed live 2026-08-04, see `_parse_path`'s docstring). Takes
    priority over `md.path` when both are given; in practice they're
    mutually exclusive (only xiaomi ever passes `path`, only ijai's own
    MapData ever populates `md.path`).

    Output contract for `out["path"]`: always a list of segments (never a
    flat point list), i.e. `[[[x,y],[x,y],...], [[x,y],...], ...]` — one
    inner list per line the card should draw independently. `md.path.path`
    (ijai) is ALSO already shaped as sub-paths internally, so this unifies
    both brands under one contract instead of the previous flat-list shape
    (which silently joined ijai's own sub-paths together the same
    physically-wrong way — a latent, previously-unnoticed instance of the
    exact same bug this was written to fix for xiaomi).
